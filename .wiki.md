# Project Summary
The Bazaar is a Progressive Web App (PWA) marketplace designed to enhance the e-commerce experience by connecting buyers with verified vendors. It offers user management, a detailed product catalog, integrated payment processing, and a modern, visually appealing interface. Although it is built on a solid technology foundation, the project currently faces significant gaps in core functionalities such as vendor tools, payment integrations, and analytics capabilities, which are essential for operational success.
